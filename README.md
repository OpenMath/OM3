This repository contains the issues of the old OM3 process (brainstorming for an OpenMath2+ or OpenMath3 standard) that were at https://trac.mathweb.org/OM3. This may or may not lead to a new version of OpenMath in the future. For actual development of the CDs and the standard, see the [CDs repository](https://github.com/OpenMath/CDs) and the [OMSTD repository](https://github.com/OpenMath/OMSTD). The issues here have all been triaged to these repositories and closed here; but they are still needed as references. So we cannot delete this repository in the forseable future.
